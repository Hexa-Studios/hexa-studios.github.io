We wanted to share some of the secrets that keep our ferry service running smoothly for all our customers!

We've worked hard on making sure that all our customers are able to stay up to date with our times and timetables so we thought we'd share how all our timetables work from our side.

Rachael (A Donegal Employee of the Month Nominee for June) and our admin team have access to a website which allows them to control all ferry crossings with a couple of clicks, here's what she sees every day.

Down the left, we have an exact copy of all the times that our customers see across our mobile apps, website and the times that Alexa will be able to list.

## How many Cars?

The main focus for the team is checking how many cars are booked on at any time. When a customer [books online](https://arranmorefastferry.com/tickets), they'll automatically turn a car red and we know when a ferry is full.

We also count the number of passengers booked here too.

We can even record who's going to be skipper and manning the boat for that crossing!

## Colours, Colours, Colours!

There's a lot of colours on our dashboard, but they all make sense to us!

Every time you see recorded in Blue is a ferry leaving Arranmore (because you're always blue when you have to leave Arranmore).

You can even see a green extra ferry here, which was running at 2am over the weekend for the [Arts Festival](https://blog.arranmorefastferry.com/earagail-arts-festival/).

All the orange colours you can see on the screen are times departing Burtonport!

## Other parts of the dashboard

We can't share all our secrets but we've got a couple more to show you!
