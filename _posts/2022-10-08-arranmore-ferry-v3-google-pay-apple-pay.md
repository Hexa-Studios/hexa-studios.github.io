We've just released a new update to the Arranmore Ferry app filled with updates to make it easier for you to book tickets and get the latest information for us!

You can download the app update for Android from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thearranmoreferry.app) and the iOS update from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/the-arranmore-ferry-blue/id1548020032) now.

We've listened to all your feedback and questions about the app and aimed to make it so much simpler. For starters - the dashboard now shows tomorrow's ferries when you missed all of todays ferries, saving you a click to tomorrows Arranmore Ferry timetables.

The navigation bar now has permanent labels for easier navigation and the Arranmore Ferry team can you send you links in the messages that appear at the top of the screen - one click and you'll be able to see what we're talking about.

## Booking a Ticket for the Arranmore Ferry

We've made booking a ticket even easier with new toggle buttons to show you exactly where you're headed and once you've confirmed we summarise everything you're doing instead of lots of icons and numbers.
