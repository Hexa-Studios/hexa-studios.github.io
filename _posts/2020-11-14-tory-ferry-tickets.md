A HUGE update to the [Tory Ferry](https://toryferry.com) app is rolling out today, you can now buy and manage your tickets to Tory Island all inside our app.

With the latest update of the Tory Ferry app, v.5.0, our customers can now create an account inside the app and can choose, pay for and view their tickets.

The bottom navigation bar has a new ticket icon which houses the ticket shop and your tickets. Simply tap in all the details of your desired journey and the orange button will pop up for you to continue.

You can enter a new card (and save it for future purchases), these cards will be saved securely on our partners secure servers, Stripe. Stripe are the leading payment developers in their industry and we do not save any credit cards.

# Tory Ferry Accounts

To save your tickets you'll need an account, we've made it as easy as we can to get you logged in - it's 2 clicks - using Apple, Google or Facebook. You can alternatively use your email address to create a new password and login.

This account will save all your tickets - your upcoming tickets will be saved in your "My Tickets" screen but your account will save all your old tickets too.

## Buying a Ticket

This is a huge update and there's lots of new parts of the app for you to experience - we've made it as easy and as clear as possible so that you know how many tickets you're buying and how much you're paying.

## What If...?

We've had to account for all sorts of scenarios inside the app - if a ferry is rerouted or cancelled you'll receive a notification and options on what to do next. In those rare instances you'll be able to request a refund, or make a change to your ticket.

# Tickets

Return tickets appear in the app in two parts (1 pass per journey), as always Departing Tory will appear in blue, while Departing Magheroarty will appear in orange.

You can open your tickets to see the full details and let your ticket be scanned by the Tory Ferry crew too.

# Web Tickets

Finally we've updated the Tory Ferry website with a ticketing process too. You'll receive an email with your ticket information rather than seeing your ticket in the app, just show this email to any of the Tory Ferry crew when on board.
The website also uses Stripe technology to securely manage your payment details via the Stripe checkout process and we only store your ticket details.

## Thanks Yous

We wanted to take a moment to thank the Ferry team for their help in integrating the payments process into the website and app.
We'd like to give Marie Clancy a big 'Thank You' too! Her first class translation work can be seen throughout the app for the entire ticketing process.

# Your Ferry Team

This is a huge update for us and we're excited to share it with you - if you have any questions at all - reach out to the Ferry team on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/toryislandferry) or give them a call on [+353 87 199 3710](tel:+353871993710) and we can help get you started with the update and get you to Tory faster.
