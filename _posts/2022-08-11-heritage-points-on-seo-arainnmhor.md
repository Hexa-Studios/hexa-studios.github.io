We're very excited to share a brand new update to the Seo Árainn Mhór mobile app - Heritage Points.

Replacing the stories in the app - you can now view selected points in the app with people from the island sharing stories in Gaeilge and Bearla.

The update, rolling out now to the Apple App Store and Google Play, will feature these Heritage Points on the stories page. Each story will feature it's own audio player and you can listen to the stories in English and Irish.

You can download the latest updates on the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/seo-%C3%A1rainn-mh%C3%B3r/id1620779594) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.hexastudios.seoarainnmhor)

# The Project

The Seo Árainn Mhór app is a project that's been devised, developed and produced on the island of Arranmore between several community groups:
- [Comharchumann Oileán Árainn Mhór](https://arranmoreisland.ie/)
- [Pleanáil Teanga Árainn Mhór](http://ptarainnmhor.ie/)
- [CFFAM Árainn Mhór](https://madeinarranmore.com/)

# Developing the Update

This update was built very quickly using the latest technology stacks:

- We're using [Directus](https://directus.io/) to manage and maintain the data in the Postgresql database
- The website is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- The mobile app is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and we've just extended that technology to include an audio player in this latest update. For more detail info on the app in general see our [launch post](https://hexastudios.co/blog/seo-arainnmhor).
