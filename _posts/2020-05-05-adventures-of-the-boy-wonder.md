For my brother's 21st Birthday I wanted to create a gift as special as my birthday present from him, the result - a mobile adventure with Owen, the Boy wonder at the centre.
A short trailer for the Adventures of the Boy Wonder
I designed the game to look as much like comic book as I could while integrating into a classic 2D platformer.

## Artwork

All the artwork was hand drawn with a digital tablet (with many iterations - drawing is hard) inspired by the style of the [JL8 comic](https://www.facebook.com/jl8comiclol) by Yale Stewart and the platformer, [Hollow Knight](https://hollowknight.com/).

# Website

In order to gift the present the game to Owen I spun up a quick website using a GatsbyJS theme at [https://adventuresoftheboywonder.com](https://adventuresoftheboywonder.com).

There's some of the initial artwork there including my very poor attempt at creating a sprite sheet for an idle animation before moving to a skeletal animation player.

## Development

The game was built using the [Unity 3d](https://unity.com/) game engine - there are great tools and resources online to guide a newbie through 2D game design basics. YouTube channels such as [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys) and [Blackthornprod](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Z1XWw1kmnvOOFsj6Bzy2g) were excellent in getting the game from an idea into it's current form.

## More to Come

The game isn't quite finished just yet, I had no idea the amount of time it would take to piece together but I intend to keep developing until all the initial ideas are in the game and it's 'complete' - I'll keep you posted with updates.
