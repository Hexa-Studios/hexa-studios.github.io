Arranmore Ferry Online Services

Tory Ferry is a ferry company based on Tory Island and runs multiple sailings throughout the day to and from Magheroarty.
---

The team behind [Arranmore Ferry](https://arranmorefastferry.com), the Realt Na Maidne Teoranta Ferry Company, launched a new [Tory Ferry service](https://toryferry.com/).

The services runs from Magheroarty, Co. Donegal and takes ~45 minutes, but due to the changing tides, ferries can run to and from Bunbeg.

A new website and mobile app was developed in time for the launch. All times are updated by the ferry team and in the event of a reroute, all tables are updated to show customers the correct information.
