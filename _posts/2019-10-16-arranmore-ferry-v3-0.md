We're very excited to announce with [Arranmore Ferry](https://arranmorefastferry.com) a massive update to their mobile application!

We've been working hard on this version of the app for a long time so indulge us for a minute and let us brag about all the new features.

The app marks the first major updated to the UI of our mobile app! We've used lots of space and gradients to display the latest times in our trademark blue and orange colours.

> As always any time in blue, is a ferry leaving Arranmore and any time leaving Burtonport is marked in Orange.

# New Navigation

We've got a new navigation system for all users, though our iPhone fans will recognise it. All devices now have a smooth bottom bar to navigate the app without having to stretch and reach to the top of the screen.

## Date Picker

We've folded our date picker into our timetables page now too. You can view the whole years timetables or choose a date.

Your chosen date will include all upcoming changes too. Any extra ferries or cancellations will be included in this timetable.

# Changes

Life on an island means you have to be ready for any weather, things change quickly and we've got you covered with our new layout Changes page.

All changes are listed chronologically meaning you get the most important information first!

You can filter your choice of extras or cancelled too. We wanted to make it as easy as possible for you to see the information you need.

# How Refreshing

All our new views can be updated with a simple swipe down. Pull down on any screen with ferry times and we'll pull the latest information from the ferry times's [admin panel](https://blog.arranmorefastferry.com/under-the-hood-at-arranmore-ferry/) and display it for you.

Thanks to the new high speed internet in Arranmore, slow download times are a thing of the past, but even so we've reduced the amount of data you're retrieving each time you refresh.

If you're not connected to the internet for any reason, we'll show a little notification to let you know you're not looking at the most up to date times.

# Coming Soon

This is the first in a series of updates. We know how important it is to keep the Gaeilge language alive, so we're working hard on translating the new app right now and we'll share this with you as soon as we have it.

Let us know what you think of the new app and what you'd like to see in the future. If you like the new app, we'd love it if you could leave us a review on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arranmore-ferry/id964609530#?platform=iphone) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.matloughnane.arranmoreff).
