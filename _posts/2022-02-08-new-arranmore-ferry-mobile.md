## App Features
The new Arranmore app features all our dashboard, where you'll see the latest for todays and tomorrows ferries, any messages from the team about the day or upcoming events will also appear here.

## Gaelige
Our whole app can be translated to Gaeilge instantly in your settings - we've worked hard to make sure everything is in the Irish language, but if you spot any English - let us know and we'll soon set it right.

## Tickets
You can now book and save and view your tickets inside the app - any  trip from Arranmore will receive a blue pass with it's own unique bar code while a pink pass signals a one way trip to everyone's favourite island from Burtonport.

Every time you book a ticket to Arranmore Island, our app will even celebrate with some confetti ðŸ¥³

## Accounts
We encourage all users to create accounts when they start using the app - you'll be able to securely save your payment details with our payments provider, Stripe and book your next tickets quickly.

With an account we'll also be able to send you personal notifications regarding the status of your ticket - don't worrk you'll still get emails as well!

## Website
Our website has had a facelift to match our new app - you'll find all the same features on the website as the app but you'll also be able to read some new from the Arranmore Ferry team on our blog. We've got lots of ideas for posts - so stay tuned.


## Feedback
