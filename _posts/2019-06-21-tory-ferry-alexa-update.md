We've updated the Tory Ferry Alexa skill to be more conversational!

We've been working on a couple of updates to the [Arranmore](https://arranmorefastferry.com) and Â [Tory Ferry Alexa skill](https://toryferry.com/alexa) to make sure that it keeps up with the evolving platform that Amazon have created.

This will start a conversation with the Tory Ferry team, you can then ask for the following information.

> What time are the next ferries?
> What are the sailings tomorrow?

# I don't have Alexa

For those without an Alexa device, you can still use the voice assistant by downloading the [Alexa app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app&amp;hl=en).
Simply login to an Amazon account and start taking to Alexa as if you had one of the echo or for products.

Alexa will give you all the relevant information, completely up to date with the [website](https://toryferry.com) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hexastudios.toryferry&amp;hl=en_GB) and [iOS](iOS) apps.
