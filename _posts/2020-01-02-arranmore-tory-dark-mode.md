We're excited to announce the newest feature on the Arranmore and Tory ferry apps, a dark mode. Dark modes have been employed across all platforms, including system wide on Apple and Android. The have had major OS updates in the last year to include darker themes and we're happy to be offering a new option for the ferry apps.

# Why Go Dark Mode?

Dark modes have several benefits including:

- [Reducing eye strain](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-you-should-you-use-dark-mode-on-the-iphone/) (particularly in low light environments)
- [Saving battery](https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/dark-mode/) (For example, at 50% brightness, the Dark Mode interface in the YouTube app saves about 15% screen energy compared to a flat white background. At 100% screen brightness, the dark interface is saving a whopping 60% of screen energy)
- Looks cool!

# How to switch it on

You can switch on the new settings by updating to the latest version of the app from the Google Play store or Apple's App Store and heading over to the settings under "My Ferry".

It's a simple switch - if you want to turn the lights down low - activate dark mode.

## New Colours

Each app has had a slight tweak to the colours - the dark mode colours are muted and deeper compared to the lighter orange tones now featured in the standard "Light" mode.

We also checked the eligibility of the text against these new colours to make sure you're not going to miss any ferries that are running to your favourite island.

# Where's my Gaeilge Settings?

Eagle eyed readers may have spotted the Language settings in the settings page, we're working hard on getting Gaeilge support into the app ASAP.
