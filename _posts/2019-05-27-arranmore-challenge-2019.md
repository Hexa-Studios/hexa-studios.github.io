We're coming up on the annual June Bank Holiday football tournament held on Arranmore Island, the Arranmore Challenge.

Each year 16 teams compete for title in a knockout tournament, the current winners are Damo's Dream having won the competition last year in a fierce final against FC Palatico.

The [website](https://arranmorechallenge.com/) is up and running counting down the seconds until the start of the tournament and is now available in [Gaeilge](https://arranmorechallenge.com/ie/). (Special thanks to Marie Clancy for her help in translating that for me).
