Last week, I visited the island of Inis Oírr, Co. Galway to visit the community, meet their businesses and share the idea of Seo Árainn Mhór.

There I met a team of people working hard to improve the islands businesses, including Daithi Gallagher from Fáilte Éireann, Meadbh Seoighe from Oifigeach Turasoireachta, Udarás na Gaeltachta and Clodagh Ni Ghoill representing lonadaí ar son Gnó Árann le CAITN.

They invited me to sit in on their 'Dragon's Den' style day where they met with businesses and shared ideas and best practises for running an Irish business including a new support programme [Digital That Delivers](https://www.failteireland.ie/digitalthatdelivers.aspx) which includes support and a grant for businesses looking to improve their digital presence.

# Seo Árainn Mhór

I was asked to present the idea of Seo Árainn Mhór to the team and how we worked to create a solution to our question:

> How to make it simple for islanders and tourists to discover Árainn Mhór?

Here's a sample of my slide deck - I think I'll have to try and learn more Gaeilge for next time!

A huge thank you to [Cormac Coyne](https://twitter.com/CormacCoyne) for making us look so good with his photos while we were exploring. More of his work is available to see here: [http://aras-eanna.ie/en/photo-gallery/](http://aras-eanna.ie/en/photo-gallery/)

Thank you to the team at [Comhar Caomhán Inis Oírr](https://www.facebook.com/comharcaomhan.inisoirr), I'll definitely be visiting the beautiful island again soon, for a longer visit next time!
