We've just completed a major overhaul of the Early's Bar website - check it out at [earlysbar.com](https://earlysbar.com)

The whole site has been updated to reflect Early's Bar, a welcoming bar on an island full of craic with traditional music for all.

New Early's Bar Home Page
# The Process

Looking back at the old site we made sure to keep what worked.

The early's logo featured prominently on the old site but we needed a new outline look for the update and its use of large images.

The colour scheme was tweaked too - we kept the nautical blue theme for the navigation menu and the sandy colour was darkened to contrast on all surfaces.

Everything else has been changed and improved upon.

# Upgrades

Over the last few years Arranmore has become a connected island, featuring in Three's ad campaign and has started a technological hub, [MODAM](https://modam.work/). Having [worked from the hub](/arranmore-modam/) it was clear we could use the new, faster internet speeds to showcase Arranmore and Early's with large gorgeous images without worrying about a bad experience visiting the site.

Featured throughout the site you'll see these images showing off what the bar has to offer - whether it's as a [music venue](https://earlysbar.com/music/), [restaurant](https://earlysbar.com/about/food-and-drink/) or just [some fun](https://earlysbar.com/about/gallery/).
