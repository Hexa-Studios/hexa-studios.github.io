There's a new idea, a proposal, for a distillery in Arranmore Island. An opportunity to promote the island and create brand new jobs.

We recently created a small one page website for the idea, which featured a video promoting the idea.
The video featured on the website.
From the projects website:

> The ambition is to create a whiskey comparable to the great malts on the market today, a visitor centre that will attract tens of thousands to Arranmore per annum, whilst creating approximately 20 full time jobs on the island.

> Be part of something special and help secure Arranmoreâ€™s future.

## The Website Code

The website was a simple design but features a form which POSTs to a Google App Script. They're a series of tools designed to integrate with Google products quickly and easily. It was very simple to develop a couple of these scripts to collect the data and notify users via email upon a new registration.

All script documentation can be found on the official [Google App Scripts](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) site.
