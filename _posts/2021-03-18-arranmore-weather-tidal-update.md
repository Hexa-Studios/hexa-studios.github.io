There's a swell update available for the Arranmore Weather up rolling out now - it's tidal data.

## Update on this Update

This update brings the final piece of the Arranmore Weather Station's data into the app, tidal data is collected every 30 minutes by the 3 data devices and is made available online. This update collects and displays all this data to give you an accurate view of the last 30 days.

## The Charts

The chart is fully interactive and displays the tides depth in mm when you select each of the individual points. There's so much data, available you have to scroll through to see the days.

The most recent data available from will appear on the left hand side of the chart and as you scroll through, you can view the historical (up to 30 days) worth of data.

The update also includes the highest and lowest tides from the last 30 days as is available for all the data collected.
