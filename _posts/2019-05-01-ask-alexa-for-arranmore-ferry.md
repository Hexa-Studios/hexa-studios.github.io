As part of our work with the [Arranmore Ferry](https://arranmorefastferry.com/) team, we've built an Alexa Skill to make the ferry times available with just your voice. Of course, all times are in sync with the mobile app and website.

You'll need to [enable the skill](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hexa-Studios-Arranmore-Ferry/dp/B07K9KNG4S) on your Amazon account and then you'll be able to ask Alexa for the next ferries, today's ferries and tomorrow's ferries.

## Next Ferries

> Alexa, Ask Arranmore Ferry, when the next sailings are

## Today or Tomorrow's Ferries

> Alexa, Ask Arranmore Ferry, what the crossings are tomorrow

Thanks to [Owen Loughnane](https://owenloughnane.com/) for his help with the promo video.

## Technical Side Note

If you're looking to develop your own Alexa skill, I'd recommend taking a look at the NodeJS ASK (Alexa Skills Kit) SDK.

These [docs](https://ask-sdk-for-nodejs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) were great in particular. The [github repo](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs) is here.
