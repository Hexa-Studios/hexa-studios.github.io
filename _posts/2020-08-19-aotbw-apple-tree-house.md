We've finally added more levels to The Adventures of the Boy Wonder, we've also added sound!

For Owen's birthday I built a game exploring his very own superhero origins. From the pages of Matman and the Boy Wonder came the mobile game, Adventures of the Boy Wonder. You can read more on it's inception from [the earlier post](/adventures-of-the-boy-wonder/) and [website](https://adventuresoftheboywonder.com/).

# The Levels

The new levels draw inspiration directly from the comic book - a story of Matman and the Boy Wonder collecting the Golden Apple of Elmfield. (We used to have an Apple Tree in our back garden growing up)

Climb the apple tree branches, evade attacks from Chronomites to jump through time
## 3 New Levels

There are 3 new levels with more chronomites, more time gems and more adventures, you'll have to have completed the original levels to play these ones.

Flying Chronomites are Everywhere!
The curves of the trees adds a new challenge to developing the game and makes the chronomites more difficult to attack. Remember you can jump off of trees, by sliding down then jumping.

There are a lot more enemies
The enemy numbers are higher - so be quick. Dodge, dip, duck, dive and... Dodge.

You're running late into the evening, look at that sunset
# Sounds

Another big update across the whole game - sound. The background track is an 8 bit version arcade sound track created and shared on YouTube by [Finn Talisker](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcUxdzmvkt_0HqH76ZSeyzg). All sound effects were collected from [FreeSound](https://freesound.org/) to complete the arcade feel.

You can change the sound effects and music settings in the settings menu too. There's no reason muting you phones volume won't work too.

# Development

These levels are smaller in width but you make up for it by moving up (climbing the tree). Here's a view of a level as a whole.
