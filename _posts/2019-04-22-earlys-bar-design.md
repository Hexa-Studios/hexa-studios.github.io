## Early's Bar gets a series of summer posters.

A while back Early's bar in Arranmore ran a series of promotions over the summer months, we helped with a small rebrand which lead to a full [website](https://earlysbar.com) overhaul later on.

## A series of summer posters
More recently we've updated their logo for their social media accounts.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/2019/04/squarelogo.jpg,/images/2019/04/earlys-xmas-squarelogo-1.jpg"
	alts="Early's Bar Main Social Media Logo,Early's Bar Christmas Logo"
%}

One of these logos was a Christmas present to the bar, can you guess which one.
