We've just completed the new [DMB Electric](https://dmbelectric.co.uk) website, and wanted to share some of our favourite parts of the site.

David from DMB Electric reached out to use a while back asking us to work with him on a new website. He already had a brand identity and social media up and running but wanted to expand his online presence with one all encompassing website, so we got to work.

## Colours and Logo 

We kept the DMB Electric colours, a bold red and electric yellow. We updated the logo ever so slightly to work well on different screen sizes, for different social media platforms and created a couple of more options in black and white too.

## Web Design

For the website we wanted to use as many images as possible demonstrating the high quality work David and his son, Billy produce on every job. David provided all these images for us and the DMB Electric [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dmb_electric/) is featured prominently on the home page - take a look at their fantastic work there.

## Customisable

We worked hard to ensure that David was able to customise the website very easily, his reviews page loads content dyanmically. David is able to update this page with reviews from his customers and share their thoughts on his work through a simple Google Sheet and the reviews are generated with the correct style.
