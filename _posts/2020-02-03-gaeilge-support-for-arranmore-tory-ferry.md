Arranmore and Tory ferries now support the Gaeilge language!
![](/images/2020/02/gaeilge-poster-settings.png)Dark and Light modes of Arranmore and Tory Ferry Apps in Gaeilge
Both Ferries now have the settings available to change the whole app into the Gaeilge language. 

If you navigate to the MyFerry / Profile part of the app, you'll be able to toggle between your language choices of English and Gaelige. The whole app will be instantly transformed into your language choice and it'll remember that decision even after future updates.

## AM and PM

Some people prefer their time in the 24 hour format and in this update we've included a little switch on the settings page to change the timestamps on each time in the app - tables and next ferry times.

# Thank You

We must thank Marie Clancy for help with the translation work, in fact if you happen to know her birthday you can see a special thank you tucked into the Arranmore date picker functionality on the timetables page! Thanks Marie!

With this latest update we've brought the Version 3.0 applications on par with the older version of the apps from October 2019. We're going to start working on some exciting new features to make sure you're getting the most out of the apps and our ferry service.
