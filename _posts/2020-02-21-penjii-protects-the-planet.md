I wanted to take a moment to share some of my work from my day job. We've just released a new mobile endless runner game, Penjii Protects the Planet, the following is the release blog from the [Caped Koala website](https://capedkoala.com/penjii-protects-the-planet/).

Penjii Protects the planet is our mobile game that aims to teach players how to save their planet! The game is a result of an Erasmus+ project with partners from Austria, Croatia, Ireland and Spain all working together to promote Green Skills.

The game is an endless runner style game, where your new favourite penguin Penjii runs around the planet to combat the problems facing our planet.

Penjii dodges past obstacles with a swipe on your phone. Swipe up to jump, down to duck and left and right to change Penjii's lane.

While the game's downloading now for your device on either [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.capedkoala.penjisplanet&amp;hl=en) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/penjii-protects-the-planet/id1463393382), learn more about the Penjii's adventures.

Penjii visits 4 different parts of the world:

1. The Antarctic
2. A Beautiful Beach
3. A Chaotic City
4. Your Home

Each level aims to teach players about a specific problem facing our environment and planet.

## Level 1: Arctic Freeze

Penjii is running across the ice dodging obstacles both man made and natural while cleaning up the oil barrels.

Beware the polar bears and foxes!

## Level 2: Beach Buster

After the cold, Penjii heads to the beach to enjoy the sun and sea but the plastic in the sea is overwhelming!

Time for Penjii to get to work, dodge the beach balls, starfish and camp fires to collect the plastic bags and protect the sea life.

## Level 3: City Slicker

Penjii heads to the big city to make sure the problem hasn't spread! There's litter everywhere! Learn about how to build a sustainable city and pick up the recyclable bottles along the way!

Watch out for the road works and rubbish on the streets!

## Level 4: Hazardous Home

Penjii makes it to a cozy home, where he picks up old light bulbs to encourage the use of their LED equivalent. Dodge through every room in the house and revive Penjii with your knowledge on keeping a green home.

# Teacher Platform

The team has built out a teachers platform too, players can log in to the game with their own login and compete with their classmates for the top spot.

Teachers can monitor their progress, their statistics and can even choose which levels are available to their class. By locking and unlocking levels teachers can steer players to specific lessons and content and tailor their classroom activities accordingly.

You can learn more about the platform on it's website at: [https://teachers.penjiithegame.com](https://teachers.penjiithegame.com)

More details about the game can also be found on our [blog post about the platform](https://capedkoala.com/news/penjiis-teacher-dashboard/).
