A huge update for the Tory Ferry app - the team are now able to send notifications to your phone for updates about changes to the service and news from the ferry team!

# Setting Up Notifications

By default the apps don't have the ability to get notifications - you will have to set up which ones you'd like to receive, or if you prefer, choose not to.

In the latest update you'll see an orange button inviting you to set up the notifications. Simply swipe through the instructions and switch on which updates you'd like receive.

Setting Up Tory Ferry Notifications in 3 swipes
## Notification Types

There are two types of notifications:

- Changes ( Any timetable changes - extra ferries or cancellations)
- News (Any news from the ferry team including new app updates, info about COVID-19 or when it starts [snowing](/its-beginning-to-look-a-lot-like-christmas/))

The ferry team will be using these notifications sparingly so as not to annoy customers with too many notifications. On top of that - each notification has been configured for a maximum lifespan of one day. So you won't receive old notifications if you turn your phone off for the weekend.

## Changed your mind?

If the notifications aren't proving useful - you can always change the settings on the "MyFerry" page. There's also a link included to jump into the notification set up page again.

Notifications on Android, iOS and where to turn them off.
# Privacy

As with any data platform now - privacy is of the utmost importance. Hexa Studios is using and industry standard library, Firebase, and it's [cloud messaging platform](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/) to send these notifications.

No personal data is stored about you and by default each device does not have notifications on by default - users 'opt-in' to the above notification types.
