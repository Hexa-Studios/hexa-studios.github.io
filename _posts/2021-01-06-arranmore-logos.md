Over the last couple of years the Arranmore GAA team have been building their ranks, in 2020 they launched a ladies team and as part of their setup, they reached out to Hexa for a crest for their jerseys. They were so happy with the result that they recommended us to the Arranmore United committee for their re-branding.

### Support the Teams

Before we show off the new designs, the Arranmore United and GAA teams are currently fundraising to prepare for when sports are able to be played after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The GAA team are in the process of getting another order together for their jerseys and hats with their logo - if you're interested in getting your hands on the merch' - reach out to them via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ArranmoreGAA">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/ArranmoreGAA/status/1344377587347443720">Twitter</a>.


## The GAA Brief

The team colours were black and white, they needed the logo to represent both GAA and Arranmore - and that was it. A dream brief for anyone starting to build about a brand. Here's a couple of the very early, unused concepts that we started with:

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/2021/arranmore-logos/gaa-trials/trial1.png,/images/2021/arranmore-logos/gaa-trials/trial2.png,/images/2021/arranmore-logos/gaa-trials/trial3.png"
	alts = "Unused pieces,Trial 1, Trial 2"
%}

## The Arranmore GAA Logo

The chosen design, as you may have seen around the island, features a simple white Arranmore outline with the official GAA logo centered on the island set against a black. The simplicity of the design means that it can be used against any number of back drops and scaled up and down as necessary.

Some different options for the team for social media and branding purposes.

# Arranmore United

The Arranmore United team was a much tougher nut to crack in terms of it's redesign. We wanted to honour the existing badge but ensure that it looked modern, represented the island well and worked at different sizes and for different use cases (for shirts, hats, flags etc).

## The Arranmore United Crest

The new design incorporates the shield, colours and island from the original and brings all the elements inside one clean shape. The new crest uses the same shape as the GAA logo (creating a small tie between the two teams) and adds some subtle detail to the background with simple waves.

The crest will work in large and small sizes and can be converted to a number of colours if necessary.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 4
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/2021/arranmore-logos/utd-logo/blue_white.png,/images/2021/arranmore-logos/utd-logo/yellow_black.png"
	alts = "Unused pieces,Trial 1, Trial 2"
%}

Here's the logo at work on some images for branding and for social media sharing.
