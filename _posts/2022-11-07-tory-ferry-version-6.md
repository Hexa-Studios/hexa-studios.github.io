We've just released a new update to the Tory Ferry app filled with updates to make it easier for you to book tickets and get the latest information for us!

You can download the app update for Android from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.hexastudios.toryferry) and the iOS update from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/tory-ferry/id1367177195?mt=8) now.

We've listened to all your feedback and questions about the app and aimed to make it so much simpler. For starters - the dashboard now shows tomorrow's ferries when you missed all of todays ferries, saving you a click to tomorrows Tory Ferry timetables.

The navigation bar now has permanent labels for easier navigation and the Tory Ferry team can you send you links in the messages that appear at the top of the screen - one click and you'll be able to see what we're talking about.

## Booking a Ticket for the Tory Ferry

We've made booking a ticket even easier with new toggle buttons to show you exactly where you're headed and once you've confirmed we summarise everything you're doing instead of lots of icons and numbers.

# Using Apple Pay

When you're ready to book your ticket - you'll be given the option to use any saved cards that you have, add a new card - or use Apple Pay! Simple tap the icon and follow the usual double click to pay with Apple Pay and you're done. Everything is securely saved in [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and we confirm your ticket on the spot! Cue confetti!

PS. We're working on Google Pay (you might see it in some of the images - it's coming soon!)
