A small but hopefully very useful feature rolling out to [Tory Ferry](https://toryferry.com)'s app. Sharing the ferry times from any date!

Sending a screenshot is so much hassle... Okay it's not but we've built a little feature into the app to make it easier to share directly from the app. It takes three clicks from the timetables page.

# 3 Click Share

1. Select the date from the timetables page to get the latest times, including extra, rerouted and cancelled ferries.
2. Click the NEW share button
3. Share the ferry times image to any app on your phone. Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram - whichever.

The update is available now on Android and iOS now. The app uses the native sharing functionality for both these ecosystems so you should be used to the way the sharing works and can get started right away.

The app doesn't store the image on your phone at all, so you won't see an increase in the storage of your app. The share button triggers a function which generates the times image on the fly and sends it to the sharing features of your device. It will also generate a short snippet of text:
