Mobile apps are a great way for businesses to define a unique experience for their customers. We blend innovative technologies with practical designs to benefit business and users alike.

All our apps go through a rigourous development life cycle to ensure a first class product.

**1. Challenges**

*Design is functional.* To build an app we take the time to understand your business and the unique challenges you face.

**2. Design & Prototyping**

Mobile users have patterns and habits that are second nature. We design solutions to use these behaviours and navigate your app.

**3. Building**

We use modern technologies to build efficient, durable code bases with clean user interfaces and interaction to delight your users.

### Case Study: Tory Ferry

[Tory Island](https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Attraction_Review-g186601-d269515-Reviews-Tory_Island-County_Donegal.html) is an island of the North West coast of Ireland with a ferry service running multiple times a day. Between weather, tidal and wind changes the [Tory Ferry](https://toryferry.com) team at Realte Na Maidne needed an app to simplify their timetabling and ticketing challenges.

We accepted the challenge and developed a control panel, API and mobile apps to give them more time back to ensure smooth sailing for their customers.

The final product brings together a wide range of features in an easy to use single app available on Android and iOS.

* Instant timetabling updates, with offline support.
* Bi-lingual Support, Gaeilge & English. 
* Notifications for real time updates from the Ferry team.
* Account creation for saving and managing tickets with single sign on functionality for major social providers.
* Payment integration for purchasing tickets.
* QR code generation & scanning for the crew to check tickets instantly.
