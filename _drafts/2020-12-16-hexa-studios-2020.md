With the end of year coming around - now's a good time to reflect on what I worked on in 2020.

To save your tickets you'll need an account, we've made it as easy as we can to get you logged in - it's 2 clicks - using Apple, Google or Facebook. You can alternatively use your email address to create a new password and login.

This account will save all your tickets - your upcoming tickets will be saved in your "My Tickets" screen but your account will save all your old tickets too.

## Buying a Ticket

This is a huge update and there's lots of new parts of the app for you to experience - we've made it as easy and as clear as possible so that you know how many tickets you're buying and how much you're paying.

## What If...?

We've had to account for all sorts of scenarios inside the app - if a ferry is rerouted or cancelled you'll receive a notification and options on what to do next. In those rare instances you'll be able to request a refund, or make a change to your ticket.

# Tickets

Return tickets appear in the app in two parts (1 pass per journey), as always Departing Tory will appear in blue, while Departing Magheroarty will appear in orange.

You can open your tickets to see the full details and let your ticket be scanned by the Tory Ferry crew too.
